# Charli XCX Tribute Website

This is a _tribute_ website dedicated to Charli XCX, an artist I've recently grown to admire deeply. 
It’s designed with inspiration from iconic album 'Brat', featuring a simple font scheme, relaxed layout and placing of elements, and of course the vibrant-green album cover aesthetic.
It is just meant to be a simple 'fanpage' of sorts, dedicated to the artist & album, for fun and to learn new technical skills!!!

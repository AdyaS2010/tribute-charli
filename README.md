# Charli XCX Tribute Website

This is a 'tribute' website dedicated to Charli XCX, an artist I've recently grown to admire deeply. 
Itâ€™s designed with inspiration from iconic album 'Brat', featuring a simple font scheme, relaxed layout and placing of elements, and of course the vibrant-green album cover aesthetic.
